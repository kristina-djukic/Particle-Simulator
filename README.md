Particle Simulator

Overview

The Particle Simulator is a Java-based project that simulates the behavior of charged particles in a two-dimensional plane. The simulator allows users to observe how particles interact with each other based on their charges and distances.

Features

Simulation of charged particles attracting or repelling each other.
Calculation of forces between particles based on their charges and distances.
Visualization of particle interactions using a graphical user interface (GUI).
Support for three simulation modes: sequential, parallel, and distributive.
Performance testing and analysis for each simulation mode.
Getting Started
To run the Particle Simulator on your local machine, follow these steps:

Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later.
MPJ Express library for distributive mode.
